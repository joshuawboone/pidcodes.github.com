ZettaLights is an Arduino SAMD based controller board designed for use in wearable and portable applications for LEDs. 
The design has pinouts to add WS1282b LED strips or arrays and an external button for control. 

Being arduino based, it can be used for various other functions. 
The design incorporates multiple designs from Adafruit Industries under the same CC BY-SA licensing with omissions and modifications for this application. (Gemma M0, MAX4466, and Micro-Lipo USB-C) 
The designs have been altered and consolidated into a single board for different battery usage, higher potential power draw, and available components.
